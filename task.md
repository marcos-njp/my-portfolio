COMPLETE REDESIGN OF PORTFOLIO! A COMPLETE OVERHAUL AND CHANGE ON ALL. REMOVE THINGS THAT ARE NOT GOOD TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PORTFOLIO.

I am not happy and satisfied it what it looks like. It does not look professional to me and its blown out. Make it more on the minimalist theme but at the same time interactive. Get rid of files that ARE NOT needed. check out the components for those.

- home or about me description
- skills and expertise, place, i will edit myself
- featured projects. if its not deployed in vercel, remove that option.
- experience (just put student), and you can put the competitions in this section if that is alright, if not then don't
- education, check my linkedin for that.
- get in touch section (send me an email) #this function should already work. 
- typical footer (built with nextjs or react, tailwind, deployed in vercel)
- AI chat section (this is soon to be added project)
# note that this is not the chronological order of sections, arranged correctly

tastes:
- i don't like my photo to be overly big or large
- i don't like super big fonts, keep it clean
- i like designs that makes the visitor check out the projects, not just scroll on them.
- i like minimalist, clean design but not too plain.
- implement dark mode and lightmode

after done, commit all changes and push. there are current commits that are not done, so maybe that is a rebase.

For this task, do not commit to github instantly, we should do a testing first before commit.
Time for the AI work using the RAG. Please read agents.md, most specially the documentations.
- free AI model that we are going to use: gpt-oss-120b.
- we will be using python for the code.
- the chat should have options for the visitor to choose which model since I want to use Gemini soon too.
- do not bruteforce, if there is a key/url that I should set up, provide the link where I can do it.
- project will be deployed using vercel so make sure you install dependencies.
