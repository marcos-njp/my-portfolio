Documentation Approach: I document everything because it helps me think clearly and helps others. My GitHub repos have detailed READMEs and code comments. I've been that confused developer reading unclear docs. Debugging & Research: I actually enjoy debugging - systematic approach, isolation, reading errors carefully. Official docs first, then GitHub issues, then Stack Overflow. I understand solutions before using them, not just copy-paste. Problem Breakdown: Break complex problems into steps.

Learned through messy histories why it matters for collaboration. Open Source Mindset: All projects public on GitHub - transparency over perfection. Bugs and suggestions are learning opportunities.
