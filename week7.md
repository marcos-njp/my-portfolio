Build MCP Server: AI-Assisted Code Generation
- Generate server actions, API endpoints, and Upstash Vector integration
- Test and debug generated code with AI assistance

RAG Repository: https://github.com/marcos-njp/my-portfolio-main-project
- this project is actually the one that we are going to create an MCP.

I highly advise you to make use of my current RAG/AI Logic since it is working already. We just need to build an MCP of it that we will first test locally.
