These are the setups, and specifications that I want you to make use of. 

use next js 15
use set shadcn
always use pnpm
keep code clean, avoid duplicate components, look if there are components that can be reusable, if none, then make one. (Refractors)
always npm run build
always npm run start


I am building my own website portfolio.
Instructions: Create a website portfolio that has a good layout and a unique approach to composition and design. 
Something that do not look like all average portfolio design but is still functional and useful.

FOR LATER:
Set up Neon Postgres DB (Prisma) from Vercel?
Upstash Vector DB for the AI database.
Vercel AI SDK for the bridge 

AI SETUP:
- Use Groq AI (NOT OpenAI) - faster and more cost-effective
- Model: llama-3.1-8b-instant for chat responses
- Upstash Vector for semantic search with RAG
- Upstash Redis for caching (optional)

Documentations you must read:
set up upstash db: https://upstash.com/docs/vector/sdks/ts/getting-started
for the ai: https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction
groq ai: https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/groq
idk why but my bootcamp has this step: https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted
