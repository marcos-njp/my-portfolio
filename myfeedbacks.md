update my vector upstash and optimize my digital-twin.json, check the grammars and keep answers straightforward.
- look for redundancies, and too repetitive answers (eg. Focusing too much on AI/ML for some reason)
- Evaluate AI restrictions in lib/ and keep them comprehensive enough, remove or reduce some if needed.
- Focus on making my vector upstash chunks better in answering via updating my digital-twin.json, and personality.json
- I want more technicalities to be included
- One reason of having too lengthy responses is digital-twin.json has too long responses, add more curly braces in one chunk if that is the correct approach.
- When updating my digital-twin.json, always reflect if the sentence structure and statements reflect my personality.json, This is more of how you write the statements, not coding the logic. Some of the statements you have generated are bad or boastful in nature, such as Taking Full ownership.
- Make sure my information is not redundant and focused on one area. For instance (just an example) Chunk 1 and Chunk 6, different question but statemetns are somewhat similar.
- fully implement RAG, and STAR. The updated shall reflect those aspects. 
- evaluate files on lib/.ts, check if some can be removed, and explain why. They may conflict each other
- IF: Digital-twin.json needs to be comrepehnsive, then train or program the AI to keep responses shorter and concise
